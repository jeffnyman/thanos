# Thanos

On 31 January 2014 Marvel Comics [put out a press release](http://marvel.com/news/comics/21871/marvel_announces_the_release_of_the_api_program) announcing an API connecting to Marvel's database of comics, characters, and creators.

Thanos provides a very simple wrapper for the [Marvel API](http://developer.marvel.com/) and attempts to make that API easily queryable by providing qualifier objects that allow a consumer of the API to drill down into specific details.

Thanos is a [Marvel super-villain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanos) and plays a large role in the current [Marvel cinematic universe](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Thanos). Thanos has routinely teamed up with Death in order to achieve universe-wide domination. As accomplishments go, that's moderately impressive, to say the least.

## Installation

To get the latest stable release, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'thanos'
```

To get the latest code:

```ruby
gem 'thanos', git: https://github.com/jnyman/thanos
```

After doing one of the above, execute the following command:

    $ bundle

You can, of course, just install the gem directly like this:

    $ gem install thanos


## Usage

Usage instructions will be coming just as soon as there is an implementation.
